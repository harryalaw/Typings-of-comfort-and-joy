Plan of attack:

-> Figure out how to add numbers together
    -> List stuff won't work for the numbers in AoC, need arbitrary precision
        -> How would you add by hand? 
            Add digit by digit, carry when needed

-> Figure out how to get lines from an input
    -> Take the example data, split it on new lines

-> How to parse input
    -> Split chunks

-> How to map over a list an apply a function


-> A reduce method
