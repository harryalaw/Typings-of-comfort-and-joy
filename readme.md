### Advent of Code solutions using the typescript type system

Inspired by the [HOTScript](https://github.com/gvergnaud/hotscript) project and armed with knowledge from going through https://type-level-typescript.com/ as well as attempting some
of the [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) I wanted to see if I could use TypeScript types to solve advent of code problems.

Many of the algorithms I've implemented for the numbers have been from me trying to figure out how to do it and using HOTScript as a reference implementation when I couldn't figure
out the algorithm fully.

I've not managed to get very far in a given year mostly since the key problem is handling the recursion limits!
